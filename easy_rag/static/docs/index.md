# Easy RAG System Documentation

## Welcome to the Easy RAG System Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive information about installing, configuring, and using the Easy RAG System. Whether you're a new user setting up the system for the first time or an experienced user looking for advanced features, you'll find the information you need here.

## What is Easy RAG System?

Easy RAG System is a user-friendly application designed to enable non-developers to create and use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The application provides a simple interface for managing documents, creating vector databases, configuring retrieval strategies, and interacting with various language models.

With Easy RAG System, you can:

- Upload and manage documents in various formats
- Convert documents into vector databases for semantic search
- Configure different retrieval strategies
- Query your documents using various language models
- Get AI-generated answers based on your document collection

## Key Concepts

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is an approach that enhances large language models by providing them with relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base. This allows the models to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses based on specific documents.

### Vector Databases

Vector databases store document chunks as numerical representations (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning. This enables semantic search, where documents are retrieved based on their meaning rather than just keyword matching.

### Embedding Models

Embedding models convert text into numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of the text. These vectors are used to find similar content in the vector database.

### Retrievers

Retrievers are components that fetch relevant document chunks from the vector database based on a query. Different retriever types use different strategies to find the most relevant information.

### Language Models (LLMs)

Language models generate human-like text based on the input they receive. In a RAG system, LLMs use the retrieved document chunks as context to generate answers to user queries.
